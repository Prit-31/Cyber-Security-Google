# CIA Triad and NIST Cybersecurity Framework Notes

## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is the foundation of information security, consisting of:

- **Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access. Example: Encryption, access controls.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring information is accurate and trustworthy. Example: Checksums, hashing, version control.
- **Availability**: Ensuring reliable access to information and systems. Example: Redundancy, backups, failover systems.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Framework provides a structured approach to cybersecurity:

1. **Identify**: Understand the business context, resources, and risks. Create asset inventory and risk assessments.
2. **Protect**: Implement safeguards to protect critical systems and data. Example: Access control, training, encryption.
3. **Detect**: Identify cybersecurity events in a timely manner. Example: Intrusion detection systems, SIEM tools.
4. **Respond**: Take action regarding a detected incident. Example: Incident response plans, communication strategies.
5. **Recover**: Restore normal operations and reduce impact. Example: Backup strategies, disaster recovery plans.

These frameworks help organizations maintain secure environments and ensure compliance with industry standards.
