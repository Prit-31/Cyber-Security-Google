# Risk Management Framework (RMF)

## What I Learned:
- RMF is developed by NIST to manage cybersecurity risk.
- Itâ€™s a 7-step process:

  1. Prepare  
  2. Categorize Information System  
  3. Select Security Controls  
  4. Implement Controls  
  5. Assess Controls  
  6. Authorize System  
  7. Monitor Controls  

## Use Case:
RMF helps government and enterprise organizations secure information systems using a structured process.
