# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## What I Learned:
NIST CSF provides a high-level strategic view of cybersecurity risk management.

### 5 Core Functions:
1. **Identify** – Understand your assets, risks  
2. **Protect** – Secure data and systems  
3. **Detect** – Monitor and identify incidents  
4. **Respond** – Take action when breaches happen  
5. **Recover** – Restore operations after an incident

## Usage:
- Helps orgs align cybersecurity to business goals
- Works with RMF and CISSP principles
